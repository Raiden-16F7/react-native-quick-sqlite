This repository is a fork of [react-native-quick-sqlite](https://github.com/ospfranco/react-native-quick-sqlite?tab=readme-ov-file) that includes custom SQLite extensions built specifically for **PowerSync**. It has been modified to meet the needs of **PowerSync**, adding features or behaviors that are different from the original repository.

It is **not** intended to be used independently, use [PowerSync React Native SDK](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-js/tree/main/packages/react-native) and install this alongside it as a peer dependency.
